        <h1>Smart Safety Helmet</h1>
        <p><strong><b>This project is funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India.</b></strong></p>   
        <p>The smart safety helmet is a promising development in workplace and road safety. It is equipped with sensors and a microcontroller that detect accidents and monitor the rider's health.</p>
        
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>The smart safety helmet project aims to prevent injuries and save lives by detecting accidents and monitoring the rider's health. Equipped with sensors, it can detect crashes, measure heart rate, and send emergency alerts to contacts. This technology can significantly enhance safety for riders.</p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>Motorcycle accidents are a major public health concern. Many riders do not wear proper helmets, leading to severe injuries and fatalities. A smart helmet can provide real-time safety features to reduce risks and improve emergency response.</p>
        
        <h2>Literature Review</h2>
        <p>Studies indicate that smart helmets can reduce head injuries by up to 50%. Research from universities highlights the benefits of accident detection and real-time health monitoring in improving emergency response times.</p>
        
        <h2>Aim & Objectives</h2>
        <p>The primary objectives of this project are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Develop an accident detection unit that alerts emergency contacts.</li>
            <li>Incorporate a pulse sensor to monitor the rider's health.</li>
            <li>Enable real-time GPS tracking for location-based alerts.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Proposed System</h2>
        <p>The helmet consists of two main units:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accident Detection Unit:</strong> Uses an accelerometer, GPS, and microcontroller to detect crashes and send alerts.</li>
            <li><strong>Pulse Monitoring Unit:</strong> Measures heart rate and displays data on an LCD.</li>
            <li><strong>Wireless Communication:</strong> Sends real-time data to a mobile app for monitoring.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>The helmet development follows these steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Research on motorcycle safety and existing solutions</li>
            <li>Designing a prototype with integrated sensors</li>
            <li>Implementing wireless data transmission</li>
            <li>Testing in a controlled environment to validate its effectiveness</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Components Used</h2>

            <li>Rechargeable Battery with Solar Charging</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Block Diagrams</h2>
        <p>The smart helmet system is divided into two main sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accident Detection Block Diagram</li>
            <li>Pulse Monitoring Block Diagram</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="smart-helmet2.png" alt="Updated Block Diagram">
        
        <h2>Experimental Results</h2>
        <p>Accident detection was successfully tested, and emergency contacts were notified immediately. Pulse rate measurement was accurate, ensuring real-time health monitoring.</p>
